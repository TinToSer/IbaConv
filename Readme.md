## Dear Iba Users

Glad to share a completely free solution to convert Iba DAT files to any other formats you like. Here you see two folders one is "GUI METHOD" which is gui automation of IbaAnalyzer using pywinauto,It's free i.e donot require iba licensing. The other folder is simple batch script which opens ibaAnalyzer using commandline and given PDO files and it requires you to buy ibaLicense. You can take a help/guide from batch script to make your own program to do the continuous conversion
